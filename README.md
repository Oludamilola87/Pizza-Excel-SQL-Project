## Project Overview:
The goal of this project was to analyze the sales performance of a sandwich manufacturing company using data analysis tools. The analysis is aimed at uncovering trends, best selling products, worst selling products, daily trend for sandwich orders etc, Rigorous data cleaning, modeling, and visualization were conducted using Power BI. I gained invaluable insights into customer sandwich preference, sales patterns, and sales performance.

## Data Source:
Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the sales_data.csv file, which contains detailed information about each sale made by the company. Dimensional table such as product category, geographical region, product, reseller, and date were created from the sales data. 

## Tools:
Data was cleaned and transformed using a power query then data analysis and visualisation were done using Power BI.
- Power Query - Data cleaning
- Power BI - Data analysis and visualization

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
- Data loading and inspection
- Data transformation (Replacing values, removing unnecessary columns, used custom columns, changing data types, e.t.c.)
- Data cleaning and formatting

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions:
- What is the overall sales trend?
- what products are top sellers?
- what is the percentage of sales and profit by sales channel?
- What is the total sales by country?
- what is the sales variance?
- what is the percentage of total expenses to sales?
- what is the total number of customers?

## Data analysis
Measures were created such as profit, previousyearsales, and count rows.

## Key Insights
Our analysis revealed some key insights and we were able to use the key insights to make recommendations.
- Significant increase in sales in FY 2019 compared to FY 2020
- Significant sales were generated in the product category named “Bikes” compared to others.
- Significant sales were made through the reseller but contributed less than 1% to the profit
- United States led in revenue, possibly due to high consumer spending

## Recommendations
- To address a significant decline in sales from FY 2019 to FY 2020, a comprehensive strategy is proposed. First, a thorough investigation into market trends, customer behavior, and external factors will uncover the root causes. Capitalizing on the success of the "Bikes" category, the company should optimize its product mix, introducing complementary items and tailoring marketing strategies to bolster this high-performing segment.
- Assessing the profitability of resellers is crucial, with adjustments in pricing, commissions, or partnerships to enhance overall profitability. Diversifying revenue streams from resellers through incentives, new products, or expanded markets can positively impact company performance.
- Given the strong performance in the United States, explore opportunities to expand into other international markets. Conduct market research to identify regions with high consumer spending and potential for the company's products.

## Conclusion
The project underlines the importance of leveraging data to optimize sales strategies to drive revenue. Through the analysis, I learned the importance of data-driven decision-making. I also gained valuable experience using Power BI for data analysis and visualization.
